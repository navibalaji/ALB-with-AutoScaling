                                                              Application load Balancer with
                                                                           Auto Scaling 

1. Create one Vpc

2. Create 4 subnets >> 2 public subnets ( az A and B) and 2 private subnets (AZ A and B)

3. Create Internet Gateway in public subnet and attach it to vpc

4. Create Nat Gateway and attach it with private subnet.

5 Create two route tables >> attach igw (public) >> attach nat gateway (private)

6. Associate subnets in both the route table

------------------------------------------------------------------------------BASIC SETUP IS COMPLETED--------------------------------------------------

7. Create Application Loadbalancer >> internet facing >> Map two public subnets >> create security group (enable port 80) >> create 2 target groups >> attach them >> create Load Balancer

8.Create Cookie Cutter ( Cookie cutter is nothing but it is an Ec2 instance) >> take ami (one for webserver 1 and another for webserver 2)

9. Create Launch Configuration >> choose Ami >> create one Security Group for Auto Scaling (port 80) >> acknowledge and launch.

10.  Create another launch configuration and attach another ami.

11. Create 2 Autoscaling Groups >> switch to launch configuration >> select configuration >> select private subnet1 >> attach to an existing loadbalancer >> choose targets >> enable health check (ELB) >> lauch 

12. same process for another autoscaling group
